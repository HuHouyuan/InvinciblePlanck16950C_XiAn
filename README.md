This is the code programmed by Morgan Hu in the VEX Robotic Team 16950C, containing various self-developed functions, such as wheel odometry, auto-aim, point-to-point locomotion, aiming while moving, self-regulated puncher force, and so on. Most of the above mentioned functions are located at the "main.cpp" in the "src" file and "task.h" and "autonomous.h" in the "include" file.     Note: The time this repository is created in Github is not the time when the code is programmed
